    "<center><h1>Creating a New UMD Dining Hall Nutrition Database and Classifying Vegetarian Dishes</h1><h4>Brooke Rice, Mitchell Smith</h4></center><hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "The University of Maryland (UMD) dining halls are famous with students for their occasionally questionable array of sustenance. Trying to find nutrition information for any given meal is also notoriously difficult due to the horrendously arranged online campus dining database. That's why we're going to do a walkthough of creating a new, accesible dining hall nutrition database and show how this data can be used to train an is-vegetarian food classifier. This will be an end-to-end tutorial covering all steps from data acquisition to generalization error estimation. Our key learning objectives are thus as follows...\n",
    "1. [(web scraping)](#scraping) get necessary nutrition facts from the UMD dining halls website\n",
    "2. [(data tidying)](#data_tidying) prepare scraped data for interpretation\n",
    "3. [(data visualization)](#database) create a read-only web database for easily querying nutrition information\n",
    "4. [(exploratory data analysis)](#eda) checking sodium and sugar contents and comparing with health guidelines\n",
    "5. [(machine learning)](#ml) train a \"contains meat\" classifier for seeing whether a given dish contains meat using only UMD dining hall data\n",
    "6. [(data analysis)](#validation) predict generalization loss and draw conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this project, we will be using the [requests library](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/), [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) to scrape and store data. We will create a searchable UI using [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and machine learning will be performed using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). Nutrition data will be sourced from https://nutrition.umd.edu/, and our generalization estimation set will come from INSERT-OTHER-NUTRITION-DB. We feel this project is relevant in that it is producing a more accessible and directly useful nutrition database while demonstrating the end to end data acquisition to machine learning analysis process.\n",

    "# Scraping the UMD dining hall nutrition data\n",
    "### Section 1: Collecting nutrition links\n",
    "Before going straight into the scraping code, check out https://nutrition.umd.edu/. After a couple clicks, you might notice that the UMD dining hall web pages attempt to display a dynmaic meal page based off the query date. Since we want our database to function regardless of the current date, we can start our search from the base page for the South Campus Dining Hall (without providing a date). We can then automatically pick up on the current day's meal information by grabbing each meal's current weblink (see [footnote](#footnote) for the case that the website has gone offline or the dining halls are currently closed). \n",
    "\n",
    "After taking care of the dynamic date query aspect, we are free to start pulling information about the foods provided for each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Each individual food item link will lead us to the nutrition facts label that we want, but these label pages do not list whether a dish is vegetarian! Instead, whether or not a food item contains meat is listed on the corresponding meal page alongside the link to an item's nutrition label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, we need to manually iterate through the food items table (as opposed to grabbing all relevant links with a single call to find_all()) and record the separate information about whether a dish is vegetarian. We can then able to cycle through each meal to copy all of the unique nutrition label links. Note that we say \"unique\" because some foods may be served across multiple meals. We'll use a set to avoid duplicate scraping."

    "After rendering each individual nutrition fact, we can append it to the dataframe we declared earlier (loading all of the pre-defined target nutrition facts). Since this is a lengthy process and we have no gaurantee that the dining hall's websites will maintain the same format forever, we should go ahead and save our final dataframe to a pickle file for safe keeping. This will allow us to continue performing analysis and hosting nutrition data even after the dining hall webpages go offline. It's also worth noting that the nutrition data above is for a single serving of the corresponding food item (which might be measured in ounces or in numbers of the food item itself)."

For our purposes, we only want the ability to read nutrition data. Only UMD dining hall workers should be able to create, update, or delete menu items. That said, to create a read-only interface for our nutrition data, we would typically recommend [bamboolib](https://bamboolib.8080labs.com/). It's the perfect tool for this sort of thing, yet we will be creating our own interface with [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for ease of HTML hosting.\n",

    "Libraries aside, we want our new nutrition database to function just like UMD's- we should be able to query for whatever food we desire (by name) and get a quick nutrition facts sheet with allergens listed. To that end, we will need to define a simple string search for finding close food matches (ie. \"fwench\" should find \"French Toast\") as well as a label generation method (for outputting nutrition information). We then want our interface to make use of these functions for a searchable nutrition dataset."

    "We would argue that the above search box is far more convenient than looking for any given food item's nutrition information on https://nutrition.umd.edu/. That said, we realize that a search box alone is not a full-fledged database. For the sake of this tutorial we will briefly demonstrate the creation of a proper SQL database using the previously recorded nutrition information.\n",
    "## Aside: Creating a true CRUD database\n",
    "A true database should implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete behavior (the CRUD standard). Since we chose to represent our data using a dataframe, we can make use of Pandas \"to_sql()\" method in order to create a Structured Query Language (SQL) database from our nutrition records. SQL is a standard language for working with relational databases which has many popular offshoots like SQLite and PostgreSQL, but we won't be diving too deep for the sake of this demonstration. Please refer to Usman Malik's [tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-sql-libraries/) if you would like to learn more about working with SQL in python.
